Here we take an agriculture dataset, with the goal to build a classifier based on a given set of attributes to determine the best crop to be grown for getting maximum benefit.

Here we performed following tasks: -
1. Checking feature distribution
2. Data quality check
3. Univariate analysis
4. Bivariate analysis
5. Feature engineering
6. Splitting the dataset into training, validation and test sets.
7. Normalization of dataset
8. Training the model using Random Forest
9. Evaluation of the model
